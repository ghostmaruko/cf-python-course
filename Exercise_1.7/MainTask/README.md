# Exercise 1.7: Finalizing Your Python Program

## Learning Goals
- Interact with a database using an object-relational mapper (ORM)
- Build your final command-line Recipe application

---

## Reflection Questions

### 1. What is an Object Relational Mapper and what are the advantages of using one?
An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) is a tool that allows developers to interact with a database using the programming language’s objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. Advantages include:
- Easier and cleaner interaction with databases using Python objects.
- Reduced risk of SQL syntax errors.
- Automatic mapping between Python classes and database tables.
- Improved code maintainability and readability.

### 2. By this point, you’ve finished creating your Recipe app. How did it go? What’s something in the app that you did well with? If you were to start over, what’s something about your app that you would change or improve?
The development went smoothly overall, especially after understanding SQLAlchemy and how to structure the database with models.  
- **Something I did well:** I implemented clear methods for creating, viewing, and calculating the difficulty of recipes, making the app user-friendly.  
- **Something I would improve:** I might refactor the input validation and menu system to be more modular and reusable, so adding new features would be easier in the future.

### 3. Imagine you’re at a job interview. You’re asked what experience you have creating an app using Python. Taking your work for this Achievement as an example, draft how you would respond to this question.
> “I developed a command-line Recipe application in Python that interacts with a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM. The app allows users to create, view, search, edit, and delete recipes. I implemented object-oriented principles to define a Recipe model with attributes and methods, including automatic difficulty calculation. I also focused on user input validation and building a clear, intuitive menu system. This project gave me hands-on experience integrating Python, databases, and object-oriented programming in a practical, functional application.”

### 4. You’ve finished Achievement 1! Before moving on to Achievement 2, take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far:

**a. What went well during this Achievement?**  
Understanding Python fundamentals and how to interact with a database using SQLAlchemy. Successfully building a functional application from scratch.

**b. What’s something you’re proud of?**  
I’m proud of completing the full Recipe app and seeing the data stored in MySQL, with all the main functionalities working as intended.

**c. What was the most challenging aspect of this Achievement?**  
Initially understanding how SQLAlchemy maps Python classes to database tables and ensuring all input validation was robust.

**d. Did this Achievement meet your expectations? Did it give you the confidence to start working with your new Python skills?**  
Yes, it met my expectations. I feel confident in my ability to create small but complete Python applications that interact with databases.

**e. What’s something you want to keep in mind to help you do your best in Achievement 2?**  
Keep practicing writing clean, modular code and always test each part of an application step by step. Also, build on the confidence gained from debugging and completing this project.
