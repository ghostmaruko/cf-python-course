# Exercise 1.2: Data Types in Python

## Learning Goals

- Explain variables and data types in Python
- Summarize the use of objects in Python
- Create a data structure for your Recipe app

## Reflection Questions

### 1. iPython Shell vs Python default shell

The main advantages of using the iPython Shell over the default Python shell are:

- **Auto-completion**: it suggests variable names, functions, and methods automatically.
- **Advanced output display**: outputs are more readable and formatted nicely.
- **Command history and magic commands**: you can quickly recall previous commands and use special commands like `%timeit` to measure execution time.
- **Easier debugging**: code can be run interactively without restarting the session.

In short, iPython is more interactive, readable, and convenient for experimenting and debugging Python code.

### 2. Examples of Python Data Types

| Data type | Definition                                               | Scalar or Non-Scalar? |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `int`     | Integer numbers (e.g., 5, -3, 100)                       | Scalar                |
| `float`   | Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)                       | Scalar                |
| `list`    | Ordered, mutable collection of objects (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) | Non-Scalar            |
| `dict`    | Collection of key-value pairs (e.g., {"a": 1, "b": 2})   | Non-Scalar            |

### 3. Difference between lists and tuples

- **List**: mutable → elements can be added, modified, or removed.
- **Tuple**: immutable → elements cannot be changed after creation.
- **Typical usage**: use a tuple when data must remain constant (e.g., as dictionary keys), and a list when elements need to be modified dynamically.

### 4. Data structure choice for a language-learning flashcard app

Each flashcard contains:

- `word` → string
- `definition` → string
- `category` → string (noun, verb, etc.)

**Recommended structure**:

- **Dictionary** for each flashcard, with keys `"word"`, `"definition"`, `"category"`.
- **List** to store all flashcards, maintaining order and allowing easy additions/removals.

**Advantages**:

- Dictionary → clear and readable access to data, easy to update individual attributes.
- List → sequential, flexible, supports dynamic modifications.

By combining a dictionary for each flashcard with a list of all flashcards, the app can easily expand to support features like quizzes, filtering by category, or adding new vocabulary.
