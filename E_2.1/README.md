## Reflection Questions

### 1. Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?

Using vanilla Python gives full control over how the application works and is suitable for very small or highly customized projects. However, it requires building many components from scratch, such as routing, security, and database handling, which increases development time and the risk of errors.

Django, on the other hand, provides a structured and secure framework with many built-in features that speed up development and encourage best practices. The drawback is that Django follows a strict structure and can feel heavy or restrictive for very simple applications.

### 2. In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?

The most significant advantage of MVT architecture is that it delegates much of the low-level control flow to the framework itself. This allows developers to focus more on application logic rather than manually managing controllers. As a result, development is faster, the codebase is cleaner, and responsibilities are more clearly separated, especially in larger projects.

### 3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement.

1. I want to gain a solid understanding of Django’s MVT architecture and how its components (models, views, and templates) interact in a real-world web application.
2. I aim to rebuild my Recipe application using Django, learning how to manage databases, business logic, and templates in a full-stack environment.
3. By the end of this Achievement, I want to feel confident creating scalable Django projects and be prepared to work professionally on backend-focused web applications.
